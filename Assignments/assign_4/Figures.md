---

![figures/0103.png](figures/0103.png)
This is the plot for the comparision of the loss of sigmoid and relu as the activation function of the hidden layer

1. We can see here that the loss for relu as the activation function is not that smooth as compared to the sigmoid function. But still is is not that much fluctuating.
2. So relu is a better choice as the activation function for the hidden layer.
